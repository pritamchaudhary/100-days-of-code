// Leetcode 455. Assign Cookies

// Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

// Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

        int i=0,j=0;
        int cnt=0;
        while(i<g.size()){
            if(j<s.size() && s[j]>=g[i]){
                cnt++;
